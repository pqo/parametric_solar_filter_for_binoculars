*jnavarro1178's original summary*

This is a holder for solar filter film for binoculars. The idea is to be able to quickly install the solar filter so as to look at the sun for sunspots and planetary transits, and then quickly remove it when done with the sun.

The solar filter film itself can be bought online, then cut so as to completely cover the printed holder hole. The ring presses the filter in place, and the covers (two per holder) allow you to store it all nicely.

I have added the scad file so that the print can be modified within reason.

Make sure that the printed holders fit snuggly onto your binocular tubes. You don't want them to come off while you are looking at the sun. Also, make sure that both tubes are covered and avoid looking at the sun without both filters snuggly fit.

Post-Printing

Snug fits

All the printed parts should fit snuggly, so that no glue should be necessary. If the fit is loose then use glue or modify the dimensions as necessary.
